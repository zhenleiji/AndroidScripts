# Setup
Download the scripts and add bash script folder to path. Please see below the steps:

1. Open .bashrc file, for example:

  ```
  zhenlei@zenbook:~$ nano .bashrc
  ```
2. Add bash script folder to path:

  ```
  export PATH=$PATH:/home/zhenlei/git/AndroidScripts
  ```

And voilà! All script in AndroidScripts folder will be recognized by command line.

**ATTENTION**

Bear in mind that genimgs script must be moved to specific folder that contains 3 folders mentioned (resources, actionbar, actionbar_land) before to run. The reason to do that is, the script was used for UI/UX team that does not know using script well, and by that just click in the script to run.
